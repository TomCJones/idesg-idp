Present: Bryan Russell (chair), Cathy Tilton, Jim Fenton, Bob
Pinheiro, Jonathan Rosenberg, Bob Faron

Approval of minutes from March 26: Approved (Fenton/Tilton)

Bryan has comments from Ann Racuya-Robbins on the terms of use. Still
waiting for input from Jim Fenton

Plenary report: Jim Fenton did the report-out at the
plenary. Discussion of where we are in the use case lifecycle, and how
we stand in particular with respect to the diversity criteria for use
case sets. The intent was that the diversity criteria do apply to this
first set of use cases, but the Management Council action required on
each set of use cases isn't entirely clear. There was mixed success in
getting the committees to review it, but they were given the
opportunity (last fall).

Some question whether the document should pass for Privacy approval:
from the AHG or SCC? Exact process probably doesn't matter, as long as
the request for approval is clear.

Discussion of Bob Pinheiro's UMA-based use case: the use case
describes granting access to a resource without the use of claims, as
might be done if a resource owner directly gave access to a resource
to another party. There was some discussion of whether this is
in-scope for the Identity Ecosystem since it doesn't involve many of
its mechanisms. Bob is revising this use case on the wiki for the next
iteration.

There were other use cases asked for at the plenary, particularly for
cloud-based services and policy-based access control.

Tom Jones did some revision of his use cases, but these changes need
more review(privacy enhanced by user agent, trust elevation)

Goal for next week is to complete the dispositions. Bryan will put out
an email to the listserv asking people to prepare any objections if
they have any.
